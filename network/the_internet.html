        <h1>The Internet</h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                The Internet (contraction of interconnected network) is the global system of
                interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices
                worldwide.
            </p>
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The internet originated with the U.S. government, which began building a computer network in the 1960s
                known as ARPANET.
                The system was replaced by new networks operated by commercial internet service providers.
                The internet was then brought to the public on a larger scale at around 1995.
            </p>
            <h2>constituent</h2>
            <p>
                It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government
                networks of local to global scope,
                linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.
            </p>
            <h2>Content and Uses</h2>
            <p>
                The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services,
                such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and
                applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for
                access and usage;
                each constituent network sets its own policies.

            <h2>Internet Protocol</h2>
            <p>
                Internet Protocol (IP): The internetâ€™s primary component and communications backbone.
                Because the internet is comprised of hardware and software layers, the IP communication standard
                is used to address schemes and identify unique connected devices. Prominent IP versions used for
                communications include Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
