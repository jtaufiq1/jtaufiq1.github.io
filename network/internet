<h1>the internet is simple a network of networks<h1>
<p>The Internet (contraction of interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks
that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.</p>

 <p>It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope,
 linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies.</p>
 
 <p>The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and
 applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.</p>
 
 <p>The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage;
 each constituent network sets its own policies.</p>
